# Predicting_Chlamydia
Using the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, I will build a classification algorithm to detect the presence of a Chlamydia Infection

The current version is using a preprocessed csv that is available in the repository. This is a part of a proejct I have already completed, I am now documenting my approach. So, I will be updating it as I reverse engineer it to completion in the script.
